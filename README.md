# Nassi-Schneiderman-Diagram

This is a project I did in a faculty course where you can view the nassi schneiderman diagram corresponding to your program.  It gets your code as input from the console, but you can choose the option to view the nassi schneiderman diagram from a text file. The code received as input can be in C++ or Pseudocode.
